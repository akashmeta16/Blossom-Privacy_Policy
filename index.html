  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Effective date:</strong> 11 August 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy applies to the Blossom Hospital mobile application (“<strong>Blossom</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>”, or “<strong>us</strong>”).
    We are committed to protecting your privacy. This document explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have when using the App.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect information that you provide directly in the App, for example when registering a patient or using features of the App. This may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic personal details (e.g., name, mobile number, age, gender, address).</li>
    <li>Photographs or documents you upload for your profile or medical records.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> collect or use your device’s precise location.
    The App may collect limited technical information (such as device model, OS version, and anonymized usage events) to help us improve performance, reliability, and user experience.
  </p>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To create and manage your account and patient profile.</li>
    <li>To provide features of the App, including telemedicine-related services where applicable.</li>
    <li>To communicate with you about appointments, updates, and support.</li>
    <li>To maintain and improve the App’s safety, security, and performance.</li>
    <li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Telemedicine</h2>
  <p>
    If you use telemedicine features, information you provide (symptoms, history, images/documents) is shared with authorized clinical staff for evaluation and care. We use secure methods to protect this information.
  </p>

  <h2>Permissions Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>INTERNET</strong>: To connect with our servers and enable online features.</li>
    <li><strong>VIBRATE</strong>: To provide haptic feedback for certain interactions.</li>
    <li><strong>CAMERA</strong>: To capture photos (e.g., profile or records) only when you choose to do so.</li>
    <li><strong>READ / WRITE EXTERNAL STORAGE</strong> (write limited to older Android versions): To let you upload or save images/documents related to your records.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="meta">Note: Denying a permission may limit related features, but you can continue to use other parts of the App.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The App may use third-party services (e.g., Google Play services) that have their own privacy practices. We encourage you to review their policies:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Services</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain user-provided data for as long as your account is active and for a reasonable period thereafter, as required for operational or legal purposes.
    We may retain anonymized or aggregated data for analytics and service improvement.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We implement reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
    If you believe a child has provided personal information through the App, please contact us so we can delete it.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Choices & Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Opt-out:</strong> You can stop all information collection by uninstalling the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Access / Update:</strong> You may request access to or correction of your information.</li>
    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You may request deletion of your account and associated data, subject to legal or clinical record-keeping requirements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
